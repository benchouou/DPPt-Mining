# Diamond/Pearl/Platinum Mining Tool

This is a simple Python utility to assist in the Sinnoh Underground mining minigame that appears in the 4th generation Pokemon games.

##To-do
1. Revise hammer/pick code to implement proper behavior 
2. Reverse code that generates treasure positions
3. Implement UI interface for user to input their inital mining screen
4. Implement "minesweeper"-like algorithm to determine next likely treasure positions

##Installation
This project currently is written for Python3. It depends on the following packages:
* Numpy 
* Matplotlib (intend to replace this when implement UI)

A brief demo of the utility is available. To see this sample, run:
`Python3 init_dig.py`
